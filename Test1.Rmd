```

테스트 시작~~!!!

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r Test1}
x <- 10
y <- 2
x * y
x ** y
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
