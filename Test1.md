Including Code
--------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
x <- 10
y <- 2
x * y
```

    ## [1] 20

``` r
x ** y
```

    ## [1] 100

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](Test1_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
